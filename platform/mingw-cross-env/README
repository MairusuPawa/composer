How to cross-compile from Linux for Windows
===========================================

1. Download and extract mingw-cross-env from http://mingw-cross-env.nongnu.org/ to your desired location.

2. Read through http://mingw-cross-env.nongnu.org/#usage to learn how to utilize all your processor cores for speedier compilation.

3. Compile GCC and its dependencies: make gcc

4. Replace ffmpeg.mk and qt.mk files in the src-subfolder of your cross-env installation with those provided in the mk-directory here. This enables Phonon and uses shared libraries instead of static ones (static libs cause trouble in linking and apparantly Phonon cannot be even built that way).

5. Compile ffmpeg and qt: make ffmpeg qt

6. Add the cross-compiler's bin directory (e.g. $HOME/mingw/usr/bin) to your PATH environment variable.

7. Run makebuilddir.sh

8. Compile editor as usual: cd build && make

9. Run makezip.sh if you want to create a simple zip package.
