Editor file format support
==========================

This document describes to what extent various file formats are supported by the editor.


Own project files
-----------------
Native save/load format. Preserves operation history (undo buffer).


SingStar XML
------------
Import and export. Round-trip is not perfect: All XML elements except MELODY, TRACK, SENTENCE and NOTE are ignored as are all attributes of SENTENCE-element. Exporter writes some useful comments.


UltraStar TXT
-------------
Import and export. All tags are not preserved.


Frets on Fire MIDI/INI
----------------------
Vocal track import and export.


Timecoded LRC / Soramimi lyrics
-------------------------------
LRC is a popular karaoke format, which has many variations. Soramimi is an old karaoke software, which uses a similar format. Composer can import the timing data but the format has no way of expressing pitch. We attempt to support reading the timecodes in many different syntaxes, including per-word timing. For maximum compatibility, exporting LRC will use the simple format, which has one time per sentence - thus import-export is a lossy operation. Some "ID Tags" are supported.


Plain text lyrics
-----------------
Raw lyrics without any timing data can be read from a file or copied from clipboard. A note is created for each word and a line break indicates sentence end.


Music files
-----------
The pitch analysis can be performed to any file that FFmpeg can decode. Playback and metadata reading support depends on Phonon media library back-end.
