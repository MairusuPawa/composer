<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This editor is designed to create notes for use in pitch analyzing karaoke games. We attempt to make the process as easy as possible by automating as much as we can. For example, the editor analyzes the song and attempts to automatically place the notes at the correct pitch.</p>


<h2><a name="workflow">Basic Workflow</a></h2>
<p>The intended workflow is documented as a handy dialog with clickable items - follow it step-by-step and in the end you have a finished notes for the song. Access it through the main menubar: Help --> Getting started.</p>


<h2><a name="tips">Tips and tricks</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>If possible, use vocals-only music tracks for best pitch analyzation (and thus auto-pitch) results.</li>
<li>In addition to copy-pasting lyrics from clipboard or loading them from a text file, you can also drag and drop text directly from other applications (like a web browser) to the editor.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="formats">File formats</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>"Native" project file format, which preserves floating note status and undo history.</li>
